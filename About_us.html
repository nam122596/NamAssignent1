      products
      are effective and clinically tested, providing real results. We help you achieve your full beauty potential in
      record time and empower you to work on your well-being for years to come.<br>Our story started in Sweden, but now
      our products are all over the world. They are adored by professionals, celebrities, and (most likely) you, so let
      us
      tell you what it’s all about.</em></p>

        <h2 style="text-align: left;"><b>How we became who we are</b></h2>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">Life can be complicated. Self-care doesn’t have to be. When we came up with the
          world’s first soft silicone facial cleansing brush LUNA™, our goal was to help you. We wanted to make a
          self-care device that’s available to you anytime, anywhere. We wanted to make you feel good by solving your
          skincare problems. Ultimately, we wanted to save your time, so you could focus on other aspects of your life
          while feeling great about yourself.<br>A decade later, we’re still doing the same. Because we know spas can be
          expensive and you don’t always have enough time to visit them. Your time is precious and your well-being
          matters. That’s why FOREO is for everyone, and we embedded that idea in our name.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col">

        <h2 style="text-align: right;"><b>“This world could be one”</b></h2>

        <p style="text-align: justify;">Inspired by Queen’s legendary song “Heaven For Everyone”, our founder Filip
          Sedić
          decided to implement Freddie Mercury’s message into the company. FOREO comes from “FOR EveryOne” and that
          illustrated our mission – to tear down labels while inspiring everyone to be themselves.<br>Together with all
          the people, we want to make this world one and emphasize its beauty by following our dream of reinventing
          beauty
          with science & technology. Our values kept us innovative, passionate, and able to think fearlessly. As a
          result,
          we shaped the beauty-tech industry and made self-care more accessible and enjoyable.</p>

        <h2><b>The leaders in beauty-tech</b></h2>

        <p>Over the years, we made several breakthroughs in the industry and came up with innovations that made
          impossible
          – possible.<br>In the words of our founder:<br>
          “We are always looking for things that can have a substantial impact, and asking which innovations can improve
          people’s lives in the most significant way. We are playing with a whole range of different things that we
          believe can have a monumental impact.”<br>
          Founder & Chief Innovation Officer,<br>
          <b>Filip Sedić</b><br>
          Today, we’re closer than ever to making that impact. Our products are loved by millions and we’re rapidly
          creating visionary, non-invasive beauty solutions. Wondering how we got this far? The answer is as sweet as
          our
          revolutionary 6-minute skincare routine.<br>
          How people feel leaves a real impact on how they deal with life. Knowing this, we decided to enable people to
          be
          more beautiful and, in turn, more confident. But we also knew you wanted to save time and be efficient about
          your skincare. This is why we made it simple and enjoyable.

        <h2><b>From routine to ritual in 6 minutes</b></h2>

        <p>You can skip most of your spa days, saving time and money, just by transforming your routine into an at-home
          ritual. This is how much pampering you can fit into 6 minutes:<br>
          - Start with a great cleanse: get rid of <b>99.5%</b> impurities with LUNA™<br>
          - Use <b>BEAR™</b> to lift the skin on your face and neck, and diminish those fine lines in no time<br>
          - Indulge in a 2-minute spa facial with <b>UFO™</b> to get the most out of active mask ingredients<br>
          - Finish the session by depuffing and taking care of dark circles under the eyes with <b>IRIS™</b><br>
          And that’s your skincare ritual. It’s effective, effortless, and saves you time – <b>millions of our users
            agree.</b>
